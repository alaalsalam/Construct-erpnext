# Codex Handoff

Read project memory and working rules first, continue from NEXT_ACTION, implement one task at a time, update memory after every task.

Current branch: feature/product-delocalization.

Canonical repository path: /home/frappe/frappe-bench/apps/Construct-erpnext.
Bench app path apps/construct_erpnext is a symlink to the canonical repository path.

El Salvador localization is disabled for the generic product build:
- after_install logs "Generic product setup completed."
- Purchase Invoice validate no longer calls the SV withholding handler.
- Legacy El Salvador setup helpers remain isolated in construct_erpnext/setup/legacy_el_salvador.py and are not executed automatically.

- Backup completed with files under sites/construction.yemenfrappe.com/private/backups/20260509_183222-*.

- construct_erpnext was installed from local branch feature/product-delocalization at commit 5686ee9 plus uncommitted delocalization changes.
